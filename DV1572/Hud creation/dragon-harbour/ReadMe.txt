DRAGON HARBOUR
A TrueType Font by S. John Ross

Dragon Harbour isn’t a Uresia-specific font by any stretch, but it’s named for Coatestown, a city that had considerable dragon troubles a few years ago. I’m doing a Coatestown piece right now for a tsunami-relief charity project, so I’ve had both dragons and harbours (note the Canadian spelling!) on the brain. I doodled this font during a writing break while pondering a draft of the city map. This is an all-caps font, but otherwise has a full keyboard set, plus a few of the usual extras. It’s free for non-commercial use; enjoy!
